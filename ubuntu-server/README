Providing link of tutorial files I have been working through
https://github.com/xcad2k/boilerplates/blob/main/packer/proxmox/ubuntu-server-jammy

Used this tutorial style guide to start setting up and working with Packer. 

My thought process has been to essentially copy the crap out of the templating and compare settings to doing things in less automated manners in order to 
get some comparison try to find what settings I'm effecting where.
